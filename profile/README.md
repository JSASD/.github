## About JSASD ‚ÑπÔ∏è
The Jersey Shore Area School District sits at the gateway to the Pennsylvania Wilds in North Central Pennsylvania.  Our 385 square miles district is on the Susquehanna River and the beautiful Pine Creek Valley with its 60-mile rail trail that runs through it.  The Jersey Shore Area School District is the 2nd largest school district in Lycoming County, which happens to also be the 9th largest geographical district in Pennsylvania.  We are a progressive school district with a forward looking vision.  Visitors have described us as a surprising gem.  We have a motivated administration, devoted teachers, and amazing students.
